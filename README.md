# Python Projects

Tic Tac Toe Game:
A classic Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python, designed for two players. This project demonstrates core Python programming concepts, including functions, loops, conditionals, and user input handling. Itâ€™s a great example of building an interactive command-line application.

Features:
Player Selection: Players can choose between 'X' or 'O'.
Dynamic Board Display: The game board updates in real-time based on player moves.
Input Validation: Ensures moves are valid and positions are not already occupied.
Win/Draw Detection: Automatically checks for win conditions or a draw after each move.
Replay Option: Players can restart the game after completion.

How to Play:
1.Players take turns entering positions (1-9) to place their symbol ('X' or 'O').
2.The game announces a winner or a draw when conditions are met.
3.Choose to replay or exit after the game.

Future Updates:
Database Integration: Log player details, game outcomes, and moves into a database.
Data Analysis: Use Python pandas to analyze player performance and game statistics.
